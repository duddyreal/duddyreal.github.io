Hey, I'm duddy!
Curious by nature.
I navigate the world of web security, reverse engineering, and forensics — and every now and then, I dive into pwn just for fun (and a bit of frustration). CTFs are my playground: I learn, explore, and sometimes even capture a few flags.

Among the many things I’m passionate about, there’s also development — the field where it all began. Today, I try to blend my background as a developer with my interests in cybersecurity and OSINT, building useful tools and digging into what lies beneath the surface.

I started this blog because, up until now, I somehow never had the brilliant idea to save my CTF writeups. Time to fix that!"
